# California_house_median_value_prediction

This is my second machine learning project made to step up into data science world!
The aim was to find the model that fit the data the best, in order to make house value prediction!
After a first data analysis, I get into modelling using 5 ML regressors and finally compare their score!
The important thing about this project was to understand which hyperparameters are worth the most for each model.
